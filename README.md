# Spectral Synthesis of Pi (SSP)

## Abstract

This paper introduces the Spectral Synthesis of Pi (SSP) algorithm, an approach designed to compute the mathematical constant π through Fourier integral representations, Chebyshev polynomial expansions, and polynomial interpolation combined with inner-product computations using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Number Theoretic Transform (NTT). SSP achieves deterministic computational complexity of O(M(n)), where M(n) represents the complexity of the underlying multiplication algorithms. This provides a theoretical improvement compared to established methods such as Chudnovsky and Arithmetic-Geometric Mean (AGM), both exhibiting complexities of O(M(n) log n).

## Introduction

The computation of π has long been essential in various scientific, mathematical, and computational fields. Historically, algorithms such as the AGM, Chudnovsky, and Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe (BBP) methods have been employed, each presenting unique advantages and limitations. AGM and Chudnovsky approaches achieve logarithmic complexity factors O(M(n) log n), whereas the BBP algorithm presents a higher complexity of O(M(n)·n), suitable primarily for digit-extraction.

## Algorithmic Procedure

The SSP algorithm involves a sequence of computational steps. Initially, it determines the number of terms N required for the desired precision level of n bits through an experimentally derived constant α, such that N = α·n.

Evaluation points x_j are computed using the formula:

x_j = cos(π·j/N), for j = 0, 1, 2, ..., N.

Next, the complex-valued function f(x) is evaluated at these points:

f(x_j) = exp(i·arccos(x_j)) / sqrt(1 - x_j²).

Polynomial interpolation using FFT efficiently calculates Chebyshev polynomial coefficients a_k, significantly optimizing computational complexity to O(M(N)).

The estimation of π is finalized through an FFT-based inner product involving the computed coefficients a_k and precomputed integral values I_k:

π ≈ Imaginary part of Σ (a_k · I_k), summed from k = 0 to N.

The computed value is then accurately rounded to the desired n-bit precision.

## Theoretical Analysis

SSP leverages Fourier integral representations, transforming π into an integral form involving complex exponentials. Chebyshev polynomials offer exponential convergence, rapidly reducing approximation errors as more polynomial terms are included.

FFT and NTT techniques facilitate polynomial interpolation and inner-product computations, maintaining computational efficiency without compromising precision. SSP's theoretical complexity of O(M(n)) contrasts with the additional logarithmic complexity factors present in AGM and Chudnovsky methods, highlighting its efficiency for high-precision computations.

## Accuracy and Precision

SSP guarantees deterministic accuracy by strictly controlling the residual error, ensuring it consistently remains below 2^(-n). This robustness makes SSP ideal for high numerical precision requirements in fields like cryptography, numerical analysis, and computational mathematics.

## Practical Implementation and Optimizations

The constant α is experimentally optimized, typically around 1.23 for one million-digit calculations, balancing computational overhead and precision.

Integer-based NTT computations eliminate floating-point rounding errors, ensuring exact modular arithmetic results. Despite a slight speed penalty compared to FFT computations, NTT ensures absolute numerical accuracy.

Advanced memory management strategies such as out-of-core FFT methods enable computations exceeding available system memory. Integral tables I_k are compressed using techniques like zstd or LZ4 and evaluated lazily to minimize computations.

SSP integration with advanced multiplication algorithms, including Schönhage–Strassen and Fürer's methods, further reduces computational complexity and enhances efficiency.

## Comparative Complexity Analysis

Comparative complexity highlights SSP's theoretical advantages:

- AGM and Chudnovsky methods: O(M(n) log n)
- BBP method: O(M(n)·n)
- SSP method: O(M(n))

This comparison underscores SSP's removal of the logarithmic complexity overhead inherent in traditional algorithms.

## Future Research Directions

Future research efforts will automate dynamic optimization of the α parameter, develop hybrid FFT/NTT computational schemes, and explore distributed computing implementations for higher precision calculations.

## Computational Environment

SSP efficiently supports multicore CPUs using libraries such as Intel MKL or FFTW3. Effective memory management techniques, like out-of-core FFT, facilitate large-scale computations beyond typical memory constraints.

## Conclusion

The Spectral Synthesis of Pi (SSP) algorithm provides a highly efficient, deterministic, and accurate methodology for π computation, significantly advancing numerical computation by eliminating logarithmic complexity factors and ensuring exceptional precision and reliability.
